# Note Taker
## Description
### This is an Express.js powered note taking app. This app is meant for anyone looking to write, save, and delete notes in a simple and intuitive setting. The bonus for this assignment was something I had some issues with. I was able to delete individual notes and update the remaining note's ids, however, the effect wouldn't render until the page is reloaded. A work around I found was to reload the window on the click event. I am sure there is a more effecient way of rendering the delete change, I will continue trying other methods and will update this part of the readme when I find a better way.
